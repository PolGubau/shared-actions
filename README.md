## Overview

This repository serves as a central hub for custom GitHub Actions that can be shared and reused across different projects. Each action is defined with:

- Versioning for backward compatibility.

By using shared actions, teams can:

- Reduce redundancy in workflow definitions.
- Centralize updates and maintenance.
- Promote consistency and best practices across projects.
